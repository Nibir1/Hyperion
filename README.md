**Hyperion** is a full-stack technical sales tool designed for the Energy Industry. It bridges the gap between complex engineering simulations and executive sales proposals.

### Why this exists
Industrial energy sales require complex calculations to prove value. Spreadsheets are error-prone, and static PDFs don't scale. Hyperion solves this by:

1. **Geospatial Physics Engine:** Instead of static estimates, it uses a **Pandas/NumPy engine** to model solar irradiance based on **Latitude and Orbital Mechanics**. It simulates a site-specific 24-hour hybrid dispatch cycle (Solar + Industrial Gas Engine + Battery).
2. **Instant Financial Feedback:** Calculates **LCOE** (Levelized Cost of Electricity), CAPEX, and CO2 reduction metrics in real-time.
3. **Context-Aware AI Automation:** Uses **LangChain & GPT-4o** to instantly draft technical proposals. The AI analyzes the **geospatial data** (e.g., solar seasonality at high latitudes) to generate location-specific value propositions.

---

## System Architecture

The application is built on a containerized Microservices architecture:

1. **Frontend (React + TypeScript):** A high-performance dashboard using **Material UI** and **Recharts** for real-time visualization of energy profiles.
2. **Calculation Engine (Python + Pandas):** A vectorised simulation layer that generates synthetic solar data and optimizes dispatch logic (Solar → Battery → Engine).
3. **Backend API (FastAPI):** Asynchronous orchestration handling simulation requests and DB transactions.
4. **Database (PostgreSQL):** Persists hardware specifications (Products) and user configurations.
5. **AI Service (LangChain):** Chains simulation KPIs into prompt templates to generate context-aware sales pitches.

## Key Features

- **Geospatial Configurator:** Sliders to adjust **Site Latitude**, Engine Count, Solar MW, and Battery MWh to model any location globally.
- **Orbital Physics Engine:** Calculates real-time solar irradiance based on Earth-Sun geometry (Declination & Elevation), visualizing the "Duck Curve" effect where engines ramp down as solar peaks.
- **Financial Modeling:** Automatic calculation of **LCOE** (Levelized Cost of Electricity), Total CAPEX, and CO2 Savings vs Coal baseline.
- **Context-Aware AI Agent:** "One-Click" generation of vendor-neutral executive summaries that analyze **site-specific solar seasonality** and reliability data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nibir1/Hyperion.git
    cd Hyperion
    ```

2.  **Set Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root or export the key directly:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxx...
    ```

3.  **Build and Run**
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

Make build command internally runs:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
@echo "Application running at http://localhost:3000"
```

### Testing & Validation

This project includes a comprehensive test suite using **Pytest** that covers **100% of the critical calculation logic** and API endpoints.

The tests run inside the Docker container to ensure environment consistency. We use:
- **In-Memory SQLite:** To perform fast, isolated database integration tests without affecting the persistence layer.
- **Unittest Mocks:** To simulate OpenAI API calls, ensuring the test suite is zero-cost and runs offline.
- **Pytest-Cov:** To verify code coverage metrics.

To run the full test suite and view the coverage report:

```bash
make tests
```

### Access Points

- **Frontend Dashboard:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend Swagger Docs:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## How It Works

### 1. The Physics Simulation (`calculations.py`)
Hyperion doesn't guess; it calculates.
- **Solar:** Generates a Gaussian bell curve peaking at 12:00 PM.
- **Battery:** Detects evening peak demand (18:00-21:00) and discharges stored energy.
- **Engines:** Fill the remaining "Net Load" gap to ensure 100% reliability.

### 2. The AI Workflow (`ai_service.py`)
1. User clicks "Generate Proposal".
2. Backend runs the simulation to get final KPIs (e.g., "45,000 Tons CO2 Saved").
3. LangChain injects these numbers into a prompt template.
4. LLM returns a cohesive paragraph explaining *why* this specific configuration is profitable.
